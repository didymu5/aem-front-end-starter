# aem-front-end-starter *A work in progess*

This is a simple maven module that combines the best parts about front-end development: watch and reload!
This project uses webpack, SCSS and TypeScript!


so far, I have aworking skeleton with a working front-end webpack build. Next I will be adding sample content and sample components and documentation to tie it all together.
